  description:"Hello! This site is meant to be a quick reference guide to sorting algorithims. It provides a quick description and a pretty animation for each algorithim. The input array is randomly generated each time this site loads and is then processed via each algorithim. The time it takes for each animation to loop is not an indicator of how fast the algorithims are, as I am only displaying noteworthy events in the processsing of said random Array.",
